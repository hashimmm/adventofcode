;; If you remove the last loop and have a look at the "compression-tree"
;; you'll immediate grasp what's happening. Kinda simple in the end.

;; For an even better idea, change the "+" of unmarked-len into string-append,
;; and the 0 into "".

;; Also, due to the algo, marker-amt is always the same as the decompressed length of
;; marker-ctree, so that's why marker-amt ends up not being used.
